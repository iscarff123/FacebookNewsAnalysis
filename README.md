# Facebook News Analysis
### Time of Project: Fall 2019
### Class Project
### Masters of Science in Data Analytics, UTSA

For this project, my classmates and I analyzed a variety of news stories posted to Facebook to find trends and draw conclusions. We examined the top four news outlets with the most stories and pointed our findings and conclusions to the Huffington Post (simulated).

**NOTE**: __Some of the graphs in the Graphs folder do not have legends. These were added later in our presentation. Please see the [Facebook Presentation](https://github.com/iscarff123/FacebookNewsAnalysis/raw/main/Facebook%20Presentation.pptx) file for complete figures with legends.__
